# Spotify_Custom_Timer
I wanted to listen to music at night through the Spotify web player, but didn't want it to play all night so I created this custom sleep timer that fades out the music and pauses the Spotify web player after a specified amount of time. 

All you need to do is create a new bookmark, title it, and paste the code into the url section. This was built for chrome so I don't know if it will work with other browsers, but I'd bet any chrome-based browser would probably work fine.

There's also a separate code to create a bookmark to cancel the timer if you clicked it accidentally or if you change your mind.
